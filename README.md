### Critical Thinking
1. Why is it important to handle errors for each individual API call rather than just at the end of the promise chain?

2. How does using custom error classes improve debugging and error identification?

3. When might a retry mechanism be more effective than an immediate failure response?

## Assignment
### Scenario
You are developing an e-commerce dashboard that fetches data from various APIs, including a product catalog, user reviews, and a sales report. Each API call could potentially fail due to network issues, incorrect endpoints, or data inconsistencies. To build a stable and user-friendly application, you need to manage these scenarios with proper error handling.

### Task
In this lab, you will build a small application that leverages asynchronous API calls using Promises. You will also implement error handling to ensure that the application can manage unexpected issues gracefully. This lab will test your ability to work with asynchronous programming concepts, as well as to manage errors effectively in a real-world scenario.
